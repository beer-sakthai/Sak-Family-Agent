# Apple Notes

Use `memo` to manage Apple Notes directly from the terminal. Notes sync across all Apple devices via iCloud.

## Prerequisites

- **macOS** with Notes.app
- Install: `brew tap antoniorodr/memo && brew install antoniorodr/memo/memo`
- Grant Automation access to Notes.app when prompted (System Settings → Privacy → Automation)

## When to Use

- User asks to create, view, or search Apple Notes
- Saving information to Notes.app for cross-device access
- Organizing notes into folders
- Exporting notes to Markdown/HTML

## Rules

1. Prefer Apple Notes when user wants cross-device sync (iPhone/iPad/Mac)
2. Use the `memory` tool for agent-internal notes that don't need to sync
3. Use the `obsidian` skill for Markdown-native knowledge management
