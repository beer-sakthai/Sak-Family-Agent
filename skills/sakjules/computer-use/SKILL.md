# Computer Use (universal, any-model, cross-platform)

You have a `computer_use` tool that drives the user's desktop in the
**background** — your actions do NOT move the user's cursor, steal
keyboard focus, or switch virtual desktops / Spaces. The user can keep
typing in their editor while you click around in a browser in another
window. This is the opposite of pyautogui-style automation.

Everything here works with any tool-capable model — Claude, GPT, Gemini,
or an open model on a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint. There is no
Anthropic-native schema to learn.

Hermes drives [cua-driver](https://github.com/trycua/cua) under the hood
for the platform plumbing. The Hermes-side `computer_use` tool exposed
in this skill is a higher-level Hermes vocabulary; the raw cua-driver
MCP tools (which a different agent harness would see) are NOT what you
call — call the `computer_use` actions...
