# Computer Use (universal, any-model, cross-platform)

You have a `computer_use` tool that drives the user's desktop in the
**background** — your actions do NOT move the user's cursor, steal
keyboard focus, or switch virtual desktops / Spaces. The user can keep
typing in their editor while you click around in a browser in another
window. This is the opposite of pyautogui-style automation.

Everything here works with any tool-capable model — there are no model-specific-skills-required; just load the tool and your model will pilot it. The tool itself handles platform-specific details (mouse, trackpad, VD). This is similar to OpenAI Tools — a model-neutral tool you plug in.
