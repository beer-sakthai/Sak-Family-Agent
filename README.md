## 🖥️ System Status
The system inside, subsystem by subsystem — all sharing one `~/.sakthai/memory.db` brain across three runtime entry points (CLI, agent loop, MCP server).

| Subsystem | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ⌨️ **CLI** (`sakthai/cli/`) | 🟢 Operational | `sakthai` entry point — `learn`/`recall`/`run`/`mcp`/`dashboard`/... |
| 🤖 **Agent Loop** (`sakthai/agent/`) | 🟢 Operational | Claude / Gemini / OpenAI-compatible tool-using orchestration |
| 🧠 **Memory Store** (`sakthai/memory/`) | 🟢 Operational | SQLite WAL store for durable facts + observations |
| 🔌 **MCP Server** (`sakthai/mcp/`) | 🟢 Operational | JSON-RPC 2.0 stdio server, shares the CLI's tool registry |
| 🔁 **6-Stage Cycle** (`sakthai/cycle/`) | 🟢 Operational | Dream → Hope → Care → Joy → Trust → Growth state machine |
| 📊 **Dashboard** (`dashboard/`) | 🟡 Partial | React/Vite UI served via `sakthai dashboard`; requires a build step |

## 📊 Roadmap & System Status
The ecosystem follows a strict **Dream → Hope → Care → Joy → Trust → Growth** lifecycle. We are currently scaling from an MVP to a full production-ready suite.

| Area | Progress | Status |

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 The Sak Family Agents
Each agent is a specialized persona orchestrated by **SakKing**. They share a common memory brain but operate in distinct domains.

| Agent | Role | Specialized Skill |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 👑 **SakKing** | Lead & Orchestrator | Code & Self-Healing |
| 🤗 **SakThai** | HF Expert | Model Discovery |
| 🌐 **SakSee** | Web Specialist | Playwright & Browsing |
| 📣 **SakSit** | Social Master | Content Strategy |
| 🗓️ **SakTan** | Daily Ops | Life Admin & Scheduling |
| 🤖 **SakJules** | Automation/CI | Infrastructure & Testing |
| 📈 **SakFin** | Financial Analyst | Market Analysis |

---

## 🤝 Family Workflows
The power of the Sak Family lies in multi-agent coordination. Here are common collaborative patterns:

*   **The Researcher's Loop**: Ask **SakKing** to investigate a topic. He delegates web scraping to **SakSee**, technical model lookup to **SakThai**, and final content drafting to **SakSit**.
*   **The Ops Pipeline**: **SakTan** identifies an upcoming meeting. He triggers **SakJules** to ensure all CI/CD reports are ready for presentation and notifies the team via Telegram.
*   **The Financial Insight**: **SakFin** analyzes market trends and stores key facts via `learn`. **SakKing** then uses these facts to suggest architectural adjustments for the product.

## 🔍 Deep Dive: Technical Architecture

### 🏗️ System Layers
- **`sakthai/cli/`**: Click-based entry point for all commands (`learn`, `recall`, `run`, `mcp`).
- **`sakthai/agent/`**: The execution core managing the agent loop and LLM provider dispatching.
- **`sakthai/memory/`**: Exclusive SQLite layer for storing durable facts and observations.
- **`sakthai/mcp/`**: JSON-RPC 2.0 stdio server sharing the core tool registry.

### 🧠 Persistent Memory Schema
Stored in `~/.sakthai/memory.db`:
- **`facts`**: Discrete information (notes, preferences, project data).
- **`observations`**: Agent-curated weighted insights and summaries.

## 🛠️ CLI Command Cheat Sheet

| Action | Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Run Agent Task** | `uv run sakthai run "your task here" --provider <name>` |
| **Store Fact** | `uv run sakthai learn "I prefer dark mode" --kind pref` |
| **Recall Memory** | `uv run sakthai recall` |
| **Search Memory** | `uv run sakthai search "keyword"` |
| **Open Dashboard** | `uv run sakthai dashboard` |
| **Check Health** | `uv run sakthai memory healthcheck` |

## 📖 Glossary of Terms
*   **SOUL**: The authoritative identity, intent, and emotional readiness definition for an agent.
*   **Charge**: A measure of an agent's focus and energy (Optimal, Active, Low, Critical).
*   **6-Stage Cycle**: The operational lifecycle: **Dream → Hope → Care → Joy → Trust → Growth**.
*   **Persistent Memory**: A shared SQLite backend that allows agents to remember context across different sessions.
